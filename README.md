# Freedom State Prison
## About
This is my 2nd ever website that I built during my Boolean course. \
Since my first project was a "Gallery of Joy" built using HTML & CSS only! \
I decided to do something a bit more practicle and disheartening. \
A prison administration system hosted on Netlify.com that turned out to be quite amusing in the end. \
Built purely on JavaScript, CSS & JSON. \
Hosted at: https://infallible-minsky-edb916.netlify.app/
